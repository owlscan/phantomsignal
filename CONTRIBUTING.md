# Contributing to NightOwl

Thanks for wanting to improve NightOwl. Here's how to get from zero to a merged PR.

---

## Dev Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-clipper/nightowl
cd nightowl
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
nightowl init          # creates ~/.nightowl/config.yaml
nightowl web           # http://localhost:5000
```

## What to Contribute

| Area | Where to look |
|---|---|
| New intelligence API | `nightowl/intel/apis/` — copy `shodan_api.py` as a template |
| New tech fingerprint | `nightowl/scrapers/tech_detector.py` |
| New export format | `nightowl/exporters/manager.py` |
| Bug fix | File an issue first if the root cause is unclear |
| Web UI / templates | `nightowl/web/templates/`, `nightowl/web/static/` |

## Adding a New API (the fast path)

The plugin system auto-registers anything decorated with `@register_api`:

```python
# nightowl/intel/apis/myapi.py
from nightowl.intel.apis.base import BaseIntelAPI, register_api, APICategory, APITier

@register_api
class MyAPI(BaseIntelAPI):
    NAME = "myapi"
    DESCRIPTION = "My source"
    REQUIRES_KEY = True
    TIER = APITier.FREE_LIMITED
    CATEGORIES = [APICategory.NETWORK]
    BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com/v1"
    SIGN_UP_URL = "https://example.com/signup"

    async def search(self, query: str, **kwargs):
        data = await self._get(f"{self.BASE_URL}/search", params={"q": query, "key": self._api_key})
        return [self._wrap_result("result", data)]
```

Then add one import line to `nightowl/intel/orchestrator.py`.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Match the existing code style (no new linting warnings)
- If you add a new API, include the `SIGN_UP_URL` so users can get a key
- Don't commit `config/nightowl.yaml` or any file containing API keys
- Reference any related issue in the PR description (`Fixes #123`)
